## Overview

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game repository, implemented using JavaScript. This classic game allows users to play against the computer, with the outcome determined by the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

##  Laguages Used:
 HTML
 CSS
 JAVA SCRIPT
 
## JavaScript Basics

### Random Number Generation

In JavaScript, `Math.random()` generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This function is commonly used to create a random element selection in games or simulations.

### Game Logic

The logic of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game is straightforward:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

### Algorithm

1. **Computer Move:**
   - The computer randomly selects a move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

2. **Comparison:**
   - The user's move is compared with the computer's move to determine the result.

3. **Score Update:**
   - The game score is updated based on the outcome.

4. **Result Display:**
   - The result of the round is displayed to the user.
     
## Local Storage
The game utilizes Local Storage, a web storage solution in JavaScript, to persistently store and retrieve data on the user's device. In this context, Local Storage is used to save and retrieve the game scores, allowing users to keep track of their performance even after refreshing the page.

## JavaScript Concepts

### DOM Manipulation

JavaScript is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), updating HTML elements dynamically. In this project, the DOM is updated to display the game results and scores.

### Event Handling

User interactions, such as button clicks, are captured and handled using JavaScript event listeners. This allows for responsive and interactive web applications.


Enjoy playing the game!
