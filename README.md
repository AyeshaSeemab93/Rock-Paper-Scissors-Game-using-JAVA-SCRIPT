### Random Number Generation

In JavaScript, `Math.random()` generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This function is commonly used to create a random element selection in games or simulations.

### Game Logic

The logic of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game is straightforward:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

### Algorithm

1. **Computer Move:**
   - The computer randomly selects a move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

2. **Comparison:**
   - The user's move is compared with the computer's move to determine the result.

3. **Score Update:**
   - The game score is updated based on the outcome.

4. **Result Display:**
   - The result of the round is displayed to the user.

## JavaScript Concepts

### DOM Manipulation

JavaScript is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), updating HTML elements dynamically. In this project, the DOM is updated to display the game results and scores.

### Event Handling

User interactions, such as button clicks, are captured and handled using JavaScript event listeners. This allows for responsive and interactive web applications.
